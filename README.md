# Nextcloud Kitinerary workflow

This app lets Nextcloud automatically convert travel documents to calendar events using KDE itinerary project. By utilizing the workflow engine it allows Nextcloud users to define rules upon which various documents are converted to calendar events. The conversion happens by feeding the source file to the kitinerary-extractor binary.
